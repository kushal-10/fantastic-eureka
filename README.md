# Spam
Final Project for Intelligent Data Analysis and Machine Learning course, at University of Potsdam SoSe 23.

## Introduction
The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify incoming emails as either spam or non-spam (legitimate). The dataset provided for this task consists of 10,000 training emails in the form of a bag-of-words representation, where each email is associated with a class label (+1 for spam and -1 for non-spam).
